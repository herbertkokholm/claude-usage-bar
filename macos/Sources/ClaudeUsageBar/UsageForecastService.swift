/// Adaptive weighted regression forecast engine for Claude usage metrics.
///
/// ## Architecture
///
/// The pipeline for each metric (5h, 7d) runs through five stages:
///
///   1. **Preprocessing** – extracts history samples, converts fractions to
///      percent, ages them in hours, and attenuates samples recorded before a
///      detected rolling-window reset drop.
///
///   2. **Adaptive λ** – estimates signal volatility from a quick first-pass
///      regression and adjusts the exponential decay constant so that memory
///      shortens when the signal changes rapidly and lengthens when it is stable.
///
///   3. **WLS regression** – fits `y = α + β·t` (linear) and `y = α + β·t + γ·t²`
///      (quadratic) using exponentially-decaying weights. `t` is hours from now,
///      so `α` is the current smoothed estimate, `β` is velocity, and `2γ` is
///      acceleration.
///
///   4. **Head / Tail ensemble** – runs two separate models at different memory
///      horizons (head: aggressive, τ ≈ 20 min; tail: conservative, τ ≈ 8 h)
///      and blends them with a smooth sigmoid whose mixing ratio is driven by
///      an instability score derived from velocity, acceleration, and noise.
///
///   5. **Confidence** – combines regression R², effective data density, and a
///      stability penalty into a single 0…1 score.
///
/// All computation is pure (no side effects, injectable `now`) for easy testing.
